        You can always email me directly. My email is below (after you put in
        the code). Otherwise, I have a contact form here powered by
        #[a(href="https://formspree.io") Formspree] for convenience or if, for
        any reason, you would rather remain as anonymous as possible when
        contacting me (Yes, I do understand the power and peace of anonymity).
        If you'd prefer instead, you may also email me directly at
        #[a(href="mailto:me@isiahmeadows.com") me@isiahmeadows.com].

    noscript: p.
        You need JavaScript enabled for this form to appear. It's dead
        otherwise. Don't worry â€’ it's not going to record your IP address or
        do any other crazy snooping when it runs. You can even
        #[a(href="https://github.com/isiahmeadows/website/blob/master/src/contact.js") verify this yourself]
        if you feel paranoid enough (and understand JavaScript). I'm not the
        one to hide evil things like secret trackers in plain sight. #[+wink]

                might want to be careful messing with the source code #[+wink].
                And while you're at it, you can always reload the page.)

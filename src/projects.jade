        +project("Mithril", "https://mithril.js.org").
            A lightweight, simple, and unopinionated MVC framework originally
            created by #[a(href="http://lhorie.blogspot.com") Leo Horie]. I am
            an active contributor to this framework, but my main focus is in the
            performance aspect, where this also really shines (it's lightweight
            enough to work very well in mobile).

        +project("m-iso", "https://github.com/isiahmeadows/m-iso").
            A now-deprecated attempt to bring Mithril server-side, which unlike
            the majority of attempts I know of, this tried to bring Mithril's
            full data model as well as mere rendering, for full server-side
            rendering and potentially other applications. Another considered
            future extension of it was to allow for multiple roots. It was
            capable from the start to render XML, XHTML, legacy HTML, and HTML5
            Polyglot, as well as regular HTML5. It could also support external
            renderers. This had not yet made it to 1.0.

        +project("babel-plugin-proto-to-create", "https://github.com/isiahmeadows/babel-plugin-proto-to-create").
            A plugin for Babel 5 to convert simple object literals that contain
            a literal #[code __proto__] property to use
            #[a(href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create") Object.create]
            and simple property assignment for regular properties and
            #[a(href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty") Object.defineProperty]
            to assign getters and setters. It is planned to update this to Babel
            6 soon.

        +project("ttyped", "https://github.com/isiahmeadows/ttyped").
            A simple runtime type-checking framework designed for LiveScript,
            JavaScript, and CoffeeScript, made to act like a function or method
            decorator. It is currently powered by
            #[a(href="http://npmjs.com/packages/type-check") type-check], but
            that may likely change in the future. It's still not yet 1.0

        +project("This Website", "https://github.com/isiahmeadows/website").
            This website itself has its source open, ready to explore. I've got
            nothing at all to hide here. No secret codes or anything that isn't
            anything obvious like a special key or password. I love open source!

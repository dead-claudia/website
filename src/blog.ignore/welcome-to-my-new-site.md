Welcome to my new site!

Yes, I've finally got my own domain as well as website running. Things new that didn't exist a month ago:

1.  I have a website that's more than merely a blog or whatever. I think that's already obvious by you being on this site.

2.  I have a domain, that's literally my name + ".com". What are the chances of that? But I've already mentioned that.

3.  I have everything all in one spot.

    Previously, I had three separate sites, one for more current music, one for my older music written in late middle school/early high school, and one for my occasionally posted-to blog. Now, I have a complete website that contains all the content from all three, plus a whole lot more content.

4.  I have a blog that is *legible*. My old blog site used a rather dark color scheme (I like my dark colors), but if you were to try to read that thing with glare from the sun or on a screen with its brightness turned down (I habitually keep mine at the lowest setting on almost everything), good luck trying to read that. I even struggle to read that at times, and I know I' better than average at detecting color differences. So I had to ditch that entirely.

    Plus, a light, simple site is *much* more inviting than a dark one. Unless it's featuring dark, gloomy castles and other fun stuff where dark colors fit in perfectly [like in this site](http://www.thebelfry.rip/), of course, and you can get a free pass on that in my book. ![wink](wink.png =16x16)

And although this site still has quite a few things left to do (like mobile
friendliness, for starters), I'm glad this is starting to come together.

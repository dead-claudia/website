## Licensing

*(Or, I don't own these fonts. I'm just using them.)*

The fonts are all under their own respective licenses, separate from the rest of the site. All of the fonts actually used on the site are in [src/fonts](../src/fonts) or inlined into the CSS. Some of these only include a subset, and most of these are converted into several other types for compatibility. They still hold the same license as the original, unless the original's license dictates otherwise, and the originals are all here.

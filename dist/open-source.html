</div><ul><li><div class=title><a href=https://github.com/isiahmeadows/website>This Website</a><a class=logo href=https://github.com/isiahmeadows/website><img src=github.png alt=GitHub></a></div><div class=body><p>This website itself is fully open-source, ready to explore. I love open source! You can see a description of the technologies used to power this website there.
<p>In particular, the website's build system is fairly elaborate in its logic, because it not only is a static site - it also prepares the blog posts (in Markdown) and includes a custom-built development server, among other things.
</div><li><div class=title><a href=https://github.com/isiahmeadows/thallium>Thallium</a><a class=logo href=https://github.com/isiahmeadows/thallium><img src=github.png alt=GitHub></a><a class=logo href=https://npmjs.com/package/thallium><img src=npm.png alt=NPM></a></div><div class=body><p>An experimental JavaScript testing framework I'm currently working on that aims to be very unopinionated, simple to use, and easy to tailor to your needs, no matter how complicated they are. My goal is to make a testing framework that gets out of your way and lets you test how you want, instead of making you conform to its opinions on how your tests should be structured or go through extensive setup and/or boilerplate to start. I want something that is small and simple for the small and simple projects, but I want to still be able to have something very powerful and structured for large applications.
</div><li><div class=title><a href=https://mithril.js.org>Mithril</a><a class=logo href=https://github.com/MithrilJS/mithril.js><img src=github.png alt=GitHub></a><a class=logo href=https://npmjs.com/package/mithril><img src=npm.png alt=NPM></a></div><div class=body><p>A lightweight, simple, and unopinionated front-end framework created by <a href=https://twitter.com/leohorie>Leo Horie</a>. I am an active core contributor, but most of my work circles around performance (where this truly shines), stability, and making it easier for people to contribute where they feel best. It's light enough and fast enough that it flies even on mobile, where there's little to no processing power.
</div><li><div class=title><a href=https://github.com/isiahmeadows/simple-require-loader>simple-require-loader</a><a class=logo href=https://github.com/isiahmeadows/simple-require-loader><img src=github.png alt=GitHub></a><a class=logo href=https://npmjs.com/package/simple-require-loader><img src=npm.png alt=NPM></a></div><div class=body><p>A very simple, minimalistic, and flexible module loader that racks up a whopping 528 bytes minified and compressed. It supports many of the features you would expect of a larger, heavier module loader, including worker support, but in a fraction of the size. It is fully tested, and it has a very simple API.
<p>It does not provide any particular facilities for bundling, but it is possible to concatenate all your modules into a single script at the end. And unlike Webpack and similar, if you want to load a bundle remotely, there is a very simple API call to load those.
<p>It was created as an experiment to see how small I could create a functional, usable, module loader that could actually potentially scale beyond a small toy project. I myself don't actively use this yet, but I have already found others interested in it themselves.</div></ul></div></div></div><div id=license><div><footer><small><p>This site does use Google Analytics for basic tracking (IP addresses not recorded), and a few third parties collect a few cookies on its own.

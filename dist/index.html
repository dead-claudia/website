It links to each site listing her rental, and it is integrated into one of the services, which provides a simple calendar widget.
<p>It's a fairly simple website with only a few pages, including a gallery for photos of the condo. It was designed to evoke an inviting, relaxing, and aesthetically beautiful feel, the very thing you would probably want to feel while on vacation, to help complement the property and location in general, and to entice visitors to choose <em>it</em> over other similar properties, to make it seem less cookie cutter.
<p>Would you like your site to be featured here next?

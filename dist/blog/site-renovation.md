Considering my site *really* needed some work (going into independent consulting), I've complete redone about a third of the content here. For one, my open source showcase is now a [subpage](./open-source.html) of the ["Showcase"](./showcase.html) page rather than the main showcase itself. I also some image editing and added quite a bit of prose.

Some of the things I've since done:

- Deleted the political blog posts
- Made the showcase a little more pictorial
- Optimized the blog a lot (blog page is rendered while DOM is still loading)
- Removed the Mithril dependency for the site (reduce download size)
- Rewrote most of the main page's content to be less blas√©
- Gained some more experience with CSS 3D transforms (how often do you get to use these cool things on websites?)
- Removed some redundant stylesheet stuff
- Made the stylesheets a bit more readable and scalable

So do feel free to explore and look around.

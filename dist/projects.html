</div><li><a href=https://mithril.js.org target=_blank>Mithril</a><div>A lightweight, simple, and unopinionated
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller target=_blank>Model-View-Controller</a>
framework originally created by <a href=http://lhorie.blogspot.com target=_blank>Leo Horie</a>. I am an active contributor to this framework, but I primarily contribute to its performance, where this also really shines. It's light enough and fast enough to work very efficiently on mobile, where most larger JavaScript frameworks struggle. My blog happens to use this framework itself.
</div><li><a href=https://github.com/isiahmeadows/techtonic target=_blank>Techtonic</a><div>An experimental test framework of I'm currently writing that eschews several existing conventions, such as traditional assertion messages and decoupled assertions, in favor for simplicity and very easy extensibility. It's still a large work in progress, but it already uses itself for its own testing.
</div><li><a href=https://github.com/isiahmeadows/m-iso target=_blank>m-iso</a><div>A now-deprecated attempt to bring Mithril server-side, which unlike the majority of attempts I know of, this tried to bring Mithril's full data model as well as mere rendering, for full server-side rendering and potentially other applications. Another considered future extension of it was to allow for multiple roots. It was capable from the start to render XML, XHTML, legacy HTML, and HTML5 Polyglot, as well as regular HTML5. It could also support external renderers. This had not yet made it to 1.0. I am considering resurrecting this project later, if enough people are interested enough.
</div><li><a href=https://github.com/isiahmeadows/babel-plugin-proto-to-create target=_blank>babel-plugin-proto-to-create</a><div>A plugin for Babel, a ECMAScript 6+ to ECMAScript 5 transpiler to convert simple object literals that contain a literal
<code>__proto__</code> property to use <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create>Object.create</a> and simple property assignment for regular properties and
<a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty>Object.defineProperty</a> to assign getters and setters. It currently is written for Babel 5, but I plan to update this to support Babel 6 eventually.
</div><li><a href=https://github.com/isiahmeadows/ttyped target=_blank>ttyped</a><div>A simple runtime type-checking framework designed for JavaScript using the <a href=https://github.com/wycats/javascript-decorators target=_blank>decorator proposal</a>,
<a href=http://livescript.net target=_blank>LiveScript</a>, and
<a href=http://coffeescript.org target=_blank>CoffeeScript</a>, made to act like a function or method decorator. It is currently powered by
<a href=http://npmjs.com/packages/type-check target=_blank>type-check</a>, but that is likely to change in the next major update. It's still highly unstable, and I have a significant change in progress which uses its own engine instead.</div></ul></div></div></div><div id=license><div><footer><small><p>All content available on this site by Isiah Meadows is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, and all source code is licensed under the ISC License, unless otherwise specified.<p><a href=https://github.com/isiahmeadows/website/blob/master/LICENSE target=_blank rel=license>See here for the text of both of these licenses.</a></small></footer></div></div></div></div>

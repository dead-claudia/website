</div><li><a href=https://github.com/isiahmeadows/thallium target=_blank>Thallium</a><div><p>An experimental JavaScript testing framework I'm currently working on that aims to be very unopinionated, simple to use, and easy to tailor to your needs, no matter how complicated they are. My goal is to make a testing framework that gets out of your way and lets you test how you want, instead of making you conform to its opinions on how your tests should be structured or go through extensive setup and/or boilerplate to start. I want something that is small and simple for the small and simple projects, but I want to still be able to have something very powerful and structured for large applications.
<p>After I finish the main implementation, I would really like to see about porting this to Python, with a few tweaks to better fit the language. I also plan on using this test framework in my own projects as it matures, even in production applications. For this reason, it is my primary project at the moment.
</div><li><a href=https://mithril.js.org target=_blank>Mithril</a><div>A lightweight, simple, and unopinionated
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller target=_blank>MVC</a>
framework created by <a href=http://lhorie.blogspot.com target=_blank>Leo Horie</a>. I am an active contributor, but my primary focus is on its performance, where this truly shines. It's light enough and fast enough that it flies even on mobile, where there's not a lot of power. Matter of fact, this website even uses Mithril in places.
</div><li><a href=https://github.com/isiahmeadows/m-iso target=_blank>m-iso</a><div><p>A deprecated attempt to port Mithril in its entirety to the server side with Node.js, with a very flexible rendering mechanism. Unlike most attempts to make Mithril interoperate with Node, this did not merely render HTML fragments, but entire web pages. It could print out modern HTML5, XML, legacy HTML and XHTML, and HTML5 Polyglot syntax as output formats, as well as any custom format you create a renderer for. I had also planned to implement the rest of Mithril's object model in this, but that proved to be too complex for the time I had available then.
<p>This project had not made it to 1.0, but I am willing to resurrect this project if enough people are interested.
</div><li><a href=https://github.com/isiahmeadows/babel-plugin-proto-to-create target=_blank>babel-plugin-proto-to-create</a><div>A plugin for Babel 5, a ECMAScript 6+ transpiler, to convert objects that contain a literal <code>__proto__</code> to use
<a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create target=_blank>Object.create</a> and simple property assignment instead for regular properties and <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty target=_blank>Object.defineProperty</a> to for getters and setters. I eventually want to update this for Babel 6.
</div><li><a href=https://github.com/isiahmeadows/ttyped target=_blank>ttyped</a><div>A simple runtime type-checking system for JavaScript via the

<a href=http://livescript.net target=_blank>LiveScript</a>, and
<a href=http://coffeescript.org target=_blank>CoffeeScript</a>, as a set of function decorators. It is currently powered by
<a href=http://npmjs.com/packages/type-check target=_blank>type-check</a>, but I have some very large changes to it slated for the next update, whenever I get it completed, including to the types themselves.</div></ul></div></div></div><div id=license><div><footer><small><p>All content available on this site by Isiah Meadows is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, and all source code is licensed under the ISC License, unless otherwise specified.<p><a href=https://github.com/isiahmeadows/website/blob/master/LICENSE target=_blank rel=license>See here for the text of both of these licenses.</a></small></footer></div></div></div></div>

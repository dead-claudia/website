I've got nothing at all to hide here. No secret codes or anything that isn't anything obvious like a special key or password. I love open source! </div></li><li><a target=_blank href=https://mithril.js.org>Mithril</a><div>A lightweight, simple, and unopinionated MVC framework originally created by <a target=_blank href=http://lhorie.blogspot.com>Leo Horie</a>. I am an active contributor to this framework, but my main focus is in performance, where this also really shines (it's light enough and fast enough to work very well in mobile). My blog also uses this. </div></li><li><a target=_blank href=https://github.com/isiahmeadows/techtonic>Techtonic</a><div>An experimental test framework that eschews several existing conventions, such as traditional assertion messages and decoupled assertions, in favor for simplicity and very easy, modular extensibility. It's still a work in progress, but it does use itself for its own testing. </div></li><li><a target=_blank href=https://github.com/isiahmeadows/m-iso>m-iso</a><div>A now-deprecated attempt to bring Mithril server-side, which unlike the majority of attempts I know of, this tried to bring Mithril's full data model as well as mere rendering, for full server-side rendering and potentially other applications. Another considered future extension of it was to allow for multiple roots. It was capable from the start to render XML, XHTML, legacy HTML, and HTML5 Polyglot, as well as regular HTML5. It could also support external renderers. This had not yet made it to 1.0. </div></li><li><a target=_blank href=https://github.com/isiahmeadows/babel-plugin-proto-to-create>babel-plugin-proto-to-create</a><div>A plugin for Babel 5 to convert simple object literals that contain a literal <code>__proto__</code> property to use
<a target=_blank href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create>Object.create</a>
and simple property assignment for regular properties and
<a target=_blank href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty>Object.defineProperty</a>
to assign getters and setters. I plan to update this to support Babel 6 eventually. </div></li><li><a target=_blank href=https://github.com/isiahmeadows/ttyped>ttyped</a><div>A simple runtime type-checking framework designed for LiveScript, JavaScript, and CoffeeScript, made to act like a function or method decorator. It is currently powered by
<a target=_blank href=http://npmjs.com/packages/type-check>type-check</a>, but that may likely change in the future. It's still highly unstable, and I have a significant change in progress.</div></li></ul></div></div></div><div id=license><div><footer><small><p>All content available on this site by Isiah Meadows is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, and all source code is licensed under the ISC License, unless otherwise specified.</p><p><a target=_blank rel=license href=https://github.com/isiahmeadows/website/blob/master/LICENSE>See here for the text of both of these licenses.</a></p></small></footer></div></div></div>

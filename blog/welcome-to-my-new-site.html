<p>Yes, I&#39;ve finally got my own domain as well as website running. Things new that didn&#39;t exist a month ago:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I have a website that&#39;s more than merely a blog or whatever. I think that&#39;s already obvious by you being on this site.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I have a domain, that&#39;s literally my name + &quot;.com&quot;. What are the chances of that? But I&#39;ve already mentioned that.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I have everything all in one spot.</p>
<p>Previously, I had three separate sites, one for more current music, one for my older music written in late middle school/early high school, and one for my occasionally posted-to blog. Now, I have a complete website that contains all the content from all three, plus a whole lot more content.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I have a blog that is <em>legible</em>. My old blog site used a rather dark color scheme (I like my dark colors), but if you were to try to read that thing with glare from the sun or on a screen with its brightness turned down (I habitually keep mine at the lowest setting on almost everything), good luck trying to read that. I even struggle to read that at times, and I know I&#39; better than average at detecting color differences. So I had to ditch that entirely.</p>
<p>Plus, a light, simple site is <em>much</em> more inviting than a dark one. Unless it&#39;s featuring dark, gloomy castles and other fun stuff where dark colors fit in perfectly <a href=http://www.thebelfry.rip/ >like in this site</a>, of course, and you can get a free pass on that in my book. <img src=wink.png alt=wink height=16 width=16></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And although this site still has quite a few things left to do (like mobile friendliness, for starters), I&#39;m glad this is starting to come together.

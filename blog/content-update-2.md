And another content update...

Let's just say it's been a while since I've visited the site's content, and so I ended up having to remove a bunch of stale things. First, as much as I'd *love* to get back to writing music, time is not my friend at the moment, and it hasn't been for a while, so I had to make it seem less current (it isn't). Also, I have replaced half the projects because I've created better things now, that are a little more worth featuring, such as a [tiny `require`-like loader](https://github.com/isiahmeadows/simple-require-loader). That and a few other projects are about dead at this point. I'm happy about m-iso, but that's probably the only one of the many dead projects I have laying around I'm still happy how it turned out.

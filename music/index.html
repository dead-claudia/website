My compositions range from very classically inspired pieces I created as far back as late middle school to darker modern classical piano solos and a single electronic song created very early college. I still enjoy improvising on my piano on frequent occasion, even though I sadly don't have as much time to compose. Most of what my more recent creations now are a mixture of piano solos and electronic music, but most of my earlier pieces are closer to modern classical with some film influences. Admittedly, these pieces are probably not too spectacular, but they're here, just in case you're curious. <img class=wink src=/images/wink.png alt="winking face">
<p>I explained my inspiration and/or relevant background on many of the pieces I created, for your reading pleasure, and to give an idea why it may seem a certain way or have a certain mood.
<p>Please note that some programs erroneously associate artwork with my pieces. That is purely the work of those programs, not me, so you can feel free to ignore it.

I also have experience with <a href=https://rubyonrails.org></a>. Some of the tools I use include <a href=https://pugjs.org>Pug</a>,
<a href=https://stylus-lang.com>Stylus</a>, and
<a href=https://mithril.js.org>Mithril</a>, all except the last of which are used in this website. I have also worked with
<a href=https://php.net>PHP</a>,
<a href=https://facebook.github.io/react/ >React.js</a>,
<a href=https://babeljs.io/ >Babel</a>,
<a href=https://wordpress.org/ >WordPress</a>,
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B>C++</a>, and
<a href=https://www.rust-lang.org/ >Rust</a> (last two only in non-web projects).
<p>I also maintain an <a href=/blog/ >occasionally updated blog</a> of various ramblings that go through my head. It's mainly intended for technical readers, so it's expected you are at least familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript already, as well as programming in general to some extent.
<p>While I was in middle school and high school, I was <em>really</em> into creating music. This was before I picked up the art form of computer programming, so much of it's probably mediocre at best. I still didn't want it all to be lost in time, so I decided to continue to keep them available <a href=/music/ >here</a>. I would love to get back to music, but I'm probably not going to continue creating much under my real name, since I like to keep my music separate from my professional life.
<p>If you have questions, comments, or concerns about whatever, you can feel free to <a href=/contact/ >contact me at any time</a>. Alternatively, if you would prefer to reach out to me via social media, you can also find me in any of these places:

I love open source! You can see a description of the technologies used to power this website there.
</div><li><a href=https://github.com/isiahmeadows/thallium class=new>Thallium</a><div><p>An experimental JavaScript testing framework I'm currently working on that aims to be very unopinionated, simple to use, and easy to tailor to your needs, no matter how complicated they are. My goal is to make a testing framework that gets out of your way and lets you test how you want, instead of making you conform to its opinions on how your tests should be structured or go through extensive setup and/or boilerplate to start. I want something that is small and simple for the small and simple projects, but I want to still be able to have something very powerful and structured for large applications.
<p>After I finish the main implementation, I would really like to see about porting this to Python, with a few tweaks to better fit the language. I also plan on using this test framework in my own projects as it matures, even in production applications. For this reason, it is my primary project at the moment.
</div><li><a href=https://mithril.js.org class=new>Mithril</a><div><p>A lightweight, simple, and unopinionated
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller class=new>MVC</a>
framework created by <a href=http://lhorie.blogspot.com class=new>Leo Horie</a>. I am an active contributor, but my primary focus is on its performance, where this truly shines, and making it easier for people to contribute where they feel best. It's light enough and fast enough that it flies even on mobile, where there's little to no processing power. Matter of fact, several parts of this website are powered by Mithril â€’ most notably, the blog is itself a
<a href=https://github.com/isiahmeadows/website/blob/master/src/blog.js class=new>small Mithril web app</a>.
</div><li><a href=https://github.com/isiahmeadows/simple-require-loader class=new>simple-require-loader</a><div><p>A very simple, minimalistic, and flexible module loader that racks up a whopping 510 bytes minified and compressed. It supports many of the features you would expect of a larger, heavier module loader, but in a fraction of the size. It is fully tested, and it has a very simple API.
<p>It does not provide any particular facilities for bundling, but it is possible to concatenate all your modules into a single script at the end. And unlike Webpack and similar, if you want to load a bundle remotely, there is a very simple API call to load those.
<p>It was created as an experiment to see how small I could create a functional, usable, module loader that could work beyond just the smallest of scales. I myself don't use this in anything, but I have already found others interested in using it themselves.
</div><li><a href=https://github.com/isiahmeadows/m-iso class=new>m-iso</a><div><p>A deprecated attempt to port Mithril in its entirety to the server side with Node.js, with a very flexible rendering mechanism. Unlike most attempts to make Mithril interoperate with Node, this did not merely render HTML fragments, but entire web pages. It could print out modern HTML5, XML, legacy HTML and XHTML, and HTML5 Polyglot syntax as output formats, as well as any custom format you create a renderer for. I had also planned to implement the rest of Mithril's object model in this, but that proved to be too complex for the time I had available then.
<p>This project had not made it to 1.0, because
<a href=https://github.com/StephanHoyer/mithril-node-render class=new>Stephen Hoyer&apos;s mithril-node-render</a>
was already fufilling a similar need and recent developments in Mithril core were already making it easier to add such support, especially with the recent core rewrite.</div></ul></div></div></div><div id=license><div><footer><small><p>All content available on this site by Isiah Meadows is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, and all source code is licensed under the ISC License, unless otherwise specified.<p><a href=https://github.com/isiahmeadows/website/blob/gh-pages/LICENSE target=_blank rel=license>See here for the text of both of these licenses.</a></small></footer></div></div></div></div>

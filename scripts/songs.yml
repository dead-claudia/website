        This was one of the first pieces I ever made. I created this back in
        middle school, although I have personally never played either part in
        its entirety. When I first wrote this duet, both parts of it were just
        barely within my technical ability.

        My inspiration was from my memories from going to
        [Cedar Point](https://www.cedarpoint.com/) as a young child, when I was
        about 7-9 years old. I missed going there then, and I still wish I could
        get a chance to go now, just to relive some of the best parts of my
        childhood.

        I wrote this piece during my senior year of high school, in a time where
        I was having trouble coping with the stress. I had myself taken off my
        medication, but I increasingly had issues coping with everything going
        on around me, effectively regressing to how I was before I was put on
        it. This piece came from how I felt in that stage of my life.

        This is a 3-part instrumental symphony, inspired by the Hunger Games
        book series. This was actually written well before the movies came out,
        as part of a creative class assignment. (There were other options as
        well, but I couldn't resist *writing music* for a school assignment.)

<a href=https://nodejs.org>Node.js</a>, a server-side JavaScript platform. I often work on tools for the back end and front end, but I also create beautiful websites for all my clients, using modern Web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, as well as several tools to help accomplish these with even more flexibility. This website itself is created to take full advantage of HTML5, CSS3, and the latest JavaScript trends where applicable. If you're interested,
<a href=contact.html?w>please contact me here</a>. (Please make sure to give me your email in that form as well.) </p><p>Another thing I enjoy to do is develop many useful <a href=projects.html>JavaScript tools</a>. These help me in creating Web sites and other tools, but I keep them open source so they can not only help me create great things, but also others who are interested as well. </p><p>I do occasionally maintain a <a href=blog.html>low-traffic blog</a> full of professional and not-so-professional whatevers that cross my head. It's mostly targeted towards those with a coding background, so it predictably has quite a bit of jargon within it. </p><p>My passions aren't limited to coding. I also enjoy playing piano (sorry, no recordings yet), listening to music, and even
<a href=music.html>creating it myself</a>. My own music spans quite a few genres, but even the music I listen to is a bit broad. Oh, and I like reading anything intellectually interesting like
<a href="http://www.iflscience.com/">IFLScience</a> or
<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/">BuzzFeed</a> (and

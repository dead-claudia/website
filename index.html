I enjoy using latest front end technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and ECMAScript 2015, as well as <a href=https://nodejs.org>Node.js</a>, a server-side JavaScript runtime. I am fluent in many of the tools used to create these sites, and I can do so with maximum reliability, flexibility, and efficiency. Where necessary, I can even create these tools myself. If you're interested, <a href=contact.html?w>please contact me here</a>, and please make sure to leave me with your email, so I can contact you back to start talking.
<p>I've loved programming for a very long time, and thus I've created several pet projects on my own. I also enjoy helping people out a lot by creating <a href=projects.html>useful JavaScript tools</a> for them, to help them get things done. I'm also a strong believer in open source.
<p>I maintain a <a href=blog.html>low-traffic blog</a> that features a nice (if you agree with me) mixture of technical things, ideas, and random ramblings about whatever. Feel free to check it out.
<p>Once upon a time (read: middle and high school), I loved to create music. This mostly predates my coding days, and as much as I wish I could continue creating, I sadly no longer have nearly the time to create and publish as I used to. In case you're curious, you can still find my old songs <a href=music.html>here</a>.</div></div></div><div id=license><div><footer><small><p>This site does use Google Analytics for basic tracking (IP addresses not recorded), and a few third parties collect a few cookies on its own.

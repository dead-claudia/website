I specialize in full stack web design and development, and I can do anything from help designing a small personal site you're working on in Wix to creating a new site for your hot startup to even writing a custom-built web app from scratch, complete with backend hosting. So if you need that magic sauce, I'm just the one you need.
<p>Here's some of what I can do:<ul><li>Assist with site builders like Wix, Weebly, and Squarespace<li>Create new sites and web apps from scratch<li>Maintain and support your existing sites or web apps<li>Work on existing Node.js, Ruby, and Wordpress/Drupal projects<li>Integrate your site with third-party services</ul><div class=contact><a href=/contact/?w>Sounds perfect to me!</a></div><h3 class=featured>Featured Site: Grand Cayman Island Vacation Rental</h3><a class=screenshot href=https://www.grandcaymanislandvacationrental.com><img src=/images/grandcaymanisland.jpg alt="screenshot of website"></a><p>This site was created to help promote a client's vacation rental condo located in the Cayman Islands. It links to each site listing her rental, and it is integrated into one of the services, which provides a simple calendar widget.
<p>It's a fairly simple website with only a few pages, including a gallery for photos of the condo. It was designed to evoke an inviting, relaxing, and aesthetically beautiful feel, the very thing you would probably want to feel while on vacation, to help complement the property and location in general, and to entice visitors to choose <em>it</em> over other similar properties, to make it seem less cookie cutter.
<p>Would you like your site to be featured here next?
